**If you could change 1 thing about your favorite 
framework/language/platform (pick one), what would it be?**

# ANSWER 

I pick Ruby on Rails as my favorite framework/language/platform. 
I wish RoR had a gem that optimized the frontend better than bootstrap
(think hotwire) without relying on JS frameworks.
